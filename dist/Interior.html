                <h1>Carpet and Floor matts</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>First take all of the matts out of the car and set them aside</li>
                    <li>Vaccum the carpets of all dirt, rocks, hair, and loose items</li>
                    <li>If the hair is not coming up, find a lint roller or a rubber brush so the hair comes out</li>
                    <li>Once everything is vaccumed, treat stains with a stain removal spray. Soak the stain, brush until soapy, then wipe and vaccum</li>
                    <li>Do these same steps with all of the floor matts. Do not forget the carpet in the trunk</li>
                    <li>(optional) Spray the fabric down with a fabric protectant to keep the carpet fresher and cleaner</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="seat">
                <h1>Seats</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Vaccum the carpets of any loose dirt or debris</li>
                    <li>Treat stains with a stain removal spray. Soak the stain, brush until soapy, then wipe and vaccum</li>
                    <li>If the seats are leather, spray them down with a any kind of cleaning spray, scrub them softy but repeditivly with an abrasive pad like a brillo pad for example</li>
                    <li>Wipe down the scrubbed seats, then repeat if neccessary. </li>
                    <li>The leather should not be shiney. People usually think that shiney leather is clean, but it is actually the opposite</li>
                    <li>Using a leather lotion on seats helps protect the leather seats. The same goes for fabric seats, use fabric protectant to elongate the cleanlyness of the fabric</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="dash">

                <ol>
                    <li>First vaccum any loose dirt, dust, hair, or debris from all of the platic surfaces</li>
                    <li>Use a non-static cleaning spray to heavily mist over all of the plastic and let soak for two minutes</li>
                    <li>Using a brillo pad scrub any dirty or shiney spots you see on the plastic</li>
                    <li>Re-spray the recently scrubbed plastics before wiping them down with a microfibre towl</li>
                    <li>Using an interior shine is a nice touch to the inside of your car. Spray the shine on the plastic evenly. Let it soak into the plastic before wiping it in with a microfibre towl</li>
                </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li>If possible do not clean the windows in the sun. Try finding some shade or doing it indoors</li>
                        <li>Find two microfibre towls. One wet towl - One dry towl</li>
                        <li>Find a proper window or glass cleaner. Make sure that if the car has window tint, find a non-ammoniated glass cleaner so the tint is not effected</li>
                        <li>Spray the window down inside and out. Wipe down the window with one towl. That is now your wet towl</li>
                        <li>With the dry towl, Wipe clean all of the streaks until the window is dry</li>
                        <li>Repeat on all of the windows</li>
