                        <ol>
                            <li>Rinse the body of the car, soap with a wash mit, then rinse</li>
                            <li>When the paint is clean and still while the car is wet, use a clay bar to pick up any abrasive dirt and grime</li>
                            <li>Dry the paint with a chamois so there is no water on the paint</li>
                            <li>If you do not have a buffer tool, apply hand wax to the paint, let dry and then wipe with a microfiber towl</li>
                            <li>If you have a buffer, you want to get a cutting compound and the appropriate buffer pad for the corresponding compound</li>
                            <li>Apply the compound with buffer to all surfaces of paint of the vehicle. Once dry, wipe off with a microfiber towl</li>
                            <li>The final step is to apply a finishing wax by hand, let dry, then wipe with a microfiber towl</li>

                            <li>Find two microfiber towls. One wet towl - One dry towl</li>
                            <li>Find a proper window or glass cleaner. Make sure that if the car has window tint, find a non-ammoniated glass cleaner so the tint is not effected</li>
                            <li>Spray the window down inside and out. Wipe down the window with one towl. That is now your wet towl</li>
                            <li>With the dry towl, Wipe clean all of the streaks until the window is dry</li>

                            <li>Cleaning the Wheels should be one of the first parts of the car you clean</li>
                            <li>Before soaking the wheels, spray the dry wheels with degreaser. Dont be shy with the spray, this is what does most of the dirty work</li>
                            <li>Right after the degreaser is applied, brush in the degreaser to the tire and wheels until both are soapy</li>
                            <li>Spray the wheel and tire down with water</li>
                            <li>Proceed to soap the tire and wheel down with the rest of the car with the regular body soap</li>
                            <li>Rinse them down, then dry them off once the soap is off of the tires and wheel</li>
                            <li>Use a silicon based tire shine to tire only. Wipe off any access tire shine of of the wheel</li>

                            <li>Wash the lights with soap and water</li>
                            <li>While still wet, use a medium grit headlight sandpaper to cut layers down off of the light until the plastic is blurry</li>
                            <li>Wipe the light down with glass cleaner and then re-scrub the light with a finer grit sandpaper</li>
                            <li>Repeat steps until you reach a comfortable visiblity on the lights</li>
