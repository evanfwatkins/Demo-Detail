I want to make a web application that lets users learn information about how they can detail the item they select on screen. They can select parts ofthe car and then will receive detailing tips for the selected item.

Some pictures that contain clickable boxes that navigate the user to one of wo main homepages. The home page will be set up where you can click on an imgage and the image you click drops down a text box that provides inform¬¬ation on how to clean the selected item. 

Will Include the following content:
-	Interactive buttons rendering different information without changing the current address
-	Text documents
-	Pictures
-	Page Navigation

User will be taken to the main page, where there will be either homepage 1 or homepage 2. There will be navigation buttons surrounding that image that will take the sure to text information. Those nav bars will drop text to the user below the home image.
