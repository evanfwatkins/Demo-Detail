## Timeline
I plan to use 20 hours a week to comeplete this project
## Design
### Font/ Images/ Colors/ Navigation:
-	I want an easy to read font throughout, so users can clearly understand the content
    o	“Arvo” – Anton Koonvit
-	I will have a head title logo up towards the top with two pictures of cars, one being interior then the other exterior
-	The user will see mostly neutral colors: a simple tan, olive, forest green, navy, and grey ash blue 
-	Navigate through the different components with simplistic ease that most can understand, without error
